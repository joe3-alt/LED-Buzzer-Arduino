# LED-Buzzer-Arduino
Arduino project with LED and Buzzer – learned from SCCI
# LED & Buzzer Project with Arduino 

This is my first simple Arduino project combining an LED and a buzzer.  
I learned it from **SCCI** and it helped me improve my skills in:  
- Controlling LEDs and buzzer through code.  
- Building circuits on a breadboard.  
- Writing, testing, and debugging Arduino programs.  
- Integrating hardware and software for interactive projects.  

You can use this project with this type of Arduino or adapt it to other Arduino boards.  

Hope it helps you learn and inspires you to create your own projects!
