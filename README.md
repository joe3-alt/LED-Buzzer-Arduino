# LED-Buzzer-Arduino
Arduino project with LED and Buzzer – learned from SCCI
# LED & Buzzer Project with Arduino 

This is my first simple Arduino project combining an LED and a buzzer.    
- Controlling LEDs and buzzer through code.  
- Building circuits on a breadboard.  
- Writing, testing, and debugging Arduino programs.  
- Integrating hardware and software for interactive projects.
- **Thats all what you want**
- 1- This project works with this Arduino model UNO, but it can also be adapted for other Arduino boards
- 2- Buzzer
- 3- LED
- 4- Resistor
- 5- Bread board
  


You can use this project with this type of Arduino or adapt it to other Arduino boards.  

Hope it helps you learn and inspires you to create your own projects!
